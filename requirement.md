# Coding Challenge: AI Immigration Chatbot with Golang and Temporal

Welcome to the coding challenge! In this challenge, you'll build a simple AI-based chatbot using Golang and Temporal that helps users understand the immigration process. Your goal is to create a chatbot that can answer basic questions about immigration, such as visa types, application processes, and common FAQs.

We will review your code with a focus on comprehensive BDD tests, clear documentation, effective workflow management using Temporal, accurate AI responses, high code quality, proper logging, robust error handling, efficient user interaction, successful deployment, and any additional bonus features.

## Requirements

1. **Golang**: Use Golang as the primary programming language for the chatbot logic.
2. **Temporal**: Utilize Temporal for managing conversation workflows.
3. **AI**: Implement a basic AI component that can respond to user queries using predefined responses or a simple machine learning model.
4. **Fun Factor**: Make the chatbot interactive and engaging.

### Features

- **User Interaction**: The chatbot should be able to handle user inputs and provide relevant responses.
- **Workflow Management**: Use Temporal to manage different states of the conversation.
- **AI Responses**: Implement a basic AI component to generate responses.

### Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and set up the development environment.
2. **Temporal Server**: Set up a Temporal server using Docker Compose.
3. **API**: Create a simple HTTP API for the chatbot.
4. **Workflows**: Implement Temporal workflows for managing the conversation.
5. **AI Component**: Integrate a basic AI component for generating responses.

### Submission

1. **Code**: Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.
2. **README**: Update the README with instructions on how to run the application.
3. **Tests**: Include unit tests for your code.
4. **Submission**: Submit your code as a GitHub repository link.

### Bonus Points

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to personalize responses.
- **Advanced AI**: Integrate a more advanced AI model for generating responses.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud service and provide a live demo link.

We hope you enjoy the challenge and look forward to seeing your creative solutions!
